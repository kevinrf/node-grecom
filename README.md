# node-grecom

## About
This Node.js package aims to provide a modern API for communicating with GRECOM radio receivers over USB with the PC interface cable accessory. A handful of desktop clients exist currently which interface directly with the devices, however those applications are proprietary and exclusive to Microsoft Windows. By nature, this package provides a cross-platform interface to the devices.

### Compatibility
I'm testing integration with my own RadioShack PRO-106.
I expect the following similar devices should work as well:
- GRECOM PSR-500
- GRECOM PSR-600
- RadioShack PRO-197
- Whistler WS1040
